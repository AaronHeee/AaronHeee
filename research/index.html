<h3>INFORMATION RETRIEVAL</h3>
<p>
    <a href="https://github.com/AaronHeee/Neural-Attentive-Item-Similarity-Model"><b>Neural Attentive Item Similarity Model for Recommendation</b></a><br/>
    A neural network model with attention mechanism for item-based Collaborative Filtering Model. This model has outperformed the art-of-the-state results.
    That's a research project in LMS Lab, led by <a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiangnan/">Dr. Xiangnan He</a><br/>
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://github.com/hexiangnan/adversarial_personalized_ranking"><b>Adversarial Personalized Ranking for Recommendation</b></a><br/>
    A new optimization framework, namely Adversarial Personalized Ranking (APR), which add adversarial noise when training, to enhance the robustness of a recommender model and thus improve its generalization performance.
    That's a research project in LMS Lab, led by <a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiangnan/">Dr. Xiangnan He</a><br/>

<h3>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/AaronHeee/Generative-Discriminative-Persona-Classification-Model"><b>Generative Discriminative Persona Classification Model</b></a><br/>
    A LSTM model for Persona Classification task based on dialogue context.
    We design Traditional Machine Learning Model as baseline and three main models in our project
    based on <a href="https://github.com/IBM/pytorch-seq2seq">seq2seq</a>, which are Discriminative, Generative and Hierarchical Model.
    That's a research project with <a href="https://rshcaroline.github.io/">Shihan Ran</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AuCson">Xisen Jin</a> in Fudan.
