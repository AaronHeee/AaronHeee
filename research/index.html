                        Item Similarity Model for Recommendation</b></a><br/> A neural network model with attention mechanism
                for item-based Collaborative Filtering Model. This model has outperformed the art-of-the-state results. That's
                a research project in LMS Lab, led by <a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiangnan/">Dr. Xiangnan He</a><br/>

                Ranking (APR), which add adversarial noise when training, to enhance the robustness of a recommender model
                and thus improve its generalization performance. That's a research project in LMS Lab, led by <a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiangnan/">Dr.
